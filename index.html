<section id ="Solar System">
<p> We all live in the solar system it has many planets like Mercury , Venus , saturn , neptune , jupiter , uranus  and earth .
 We also have are very own Sun . The Sun is a star. There are lots of stars, but the Sun is 
 the closest one to Earth. It is the center of our solar system. The Sun is a hot ball of glowing gases. 
 It keeps our planet warm enough for living things to thrive. If we don't have the sun we will all die . What if someone asks how
 much time does it take for sunlight to reach our Planet and other planets ? The answer will come in seconds and minutes but to know 
 the actual time taken read the next paragraph

<section id ="How Much Time">
<p>Here's the math. We orbit the Sun at a distance of about 150 million km. Light moves at 300,000 kilometers/second. Divide these and you get 500 seconds, or 8 minutes and 20 seconds.
 This is an average number. Remember, the Earth follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun, ranging from 147 million to 152 million km. At its closest point, sunlight only 
 takes 490 seconds to reach Earth and then at the most distant point, it takes 507 seconds for sunlight to make the journey.
